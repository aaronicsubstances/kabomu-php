# Kabomu Library for PHP

This is a port of the Kabomu library originally written in C#.NET to PHP 8.1 and above.

In a nutshell, Kabomu enables building quasi web applications that can connect endpoints within localhost and even within an OS process, through IPC mechanisms other than TCP.

See the [repository for the .NET version](https://github.com/aaronicsubstances/cskabomu) for more details.

## Install

```
composer require aaronicsubstances/kabomu
```
